# COSS
>A fast and user-friendly tool for spectral library searching

Group members: Mohammad and Matthias


## About the search engine
- spectral library search
- probabilistic scoring function (similar to Andromeda) that includes decoy spectra generation
- available as `java` executable from GitHub

## Run
1. Download COSS from the provided link and unzip it.
2. Download `E.coli` and `H.sapiens` spectral libraries from [Pride](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/cluster/#/libraries)
3. Concatenate the libraries: `cat Human.msp Escherichia_coli.msp > concat.msp`

**NO MODS allowed**
We need an own library including the TMT information.
